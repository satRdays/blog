# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))
**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.


## Quick Start

### General info
To work with the blog, always use the `gh-pages` branch

### Adding new posts
Posts are nothing more than markdown (*.md) files.
Instead of me typing a full guide on how to add new posts, it's perhaps better to [refer to the original documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/).

However, keep the following basic guidelines in mind to get you started

1. Always use the "/_posts/" folder

2. Press the "+" icon while in "/_posts/" to create a new file.

3. Filenames should be "year-month-day-title.md", for example: "2016-07-10-My-first-post.md"

4. Always keep the following 4 lines at the top of the file

```
---
layout: post
title: Alter this part for a different title!
---
```
